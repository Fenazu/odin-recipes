    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This blueberry muffin recipe makes eight extra large and yummy breakfast.</p>
    <p>I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose fluor</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F or 200 degrees C. Grease 8 muffin cups or line with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Whisk fluor, sugar, baking powder and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark; stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries; set batter aside.</li>
        <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
