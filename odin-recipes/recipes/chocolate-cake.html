    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Skip the store-bought mix and make this one-bowl chocolate cake from scratch. It's almost as easy as the boxed stuff, but it's <em>so </em>much more delicious.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 3/4 all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla; mix for 2 minutes on medium speed with an eletric mixer.</li>
        <li>Stir in the boiling water. The batter will be thin.</li>
        <li>Pour evenly into the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick insertedinto the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
